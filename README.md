# StopWatch
This stopwatch was developed as part of a web development competition. It features accurate timekeeping, start/stop functionality, and a clean user interface. Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive stopwatchÂ experience.
It was my first task at @Prodigy infotech as an intern in Web development
